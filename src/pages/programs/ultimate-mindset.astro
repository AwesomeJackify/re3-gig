You will watch 2 videos per week on 2 different life tools and implement these tools for that week and the weeks to come. By the time you get to week 5, you will be practicing 6 of these tools daily.",

Armed with the tools from Re:Do, in these final 6 weeks you will learn to map out your new daily routine, learn to write and break down goals with Tim, and unlock your life's full potential. You will also learn to identify bad cycles and how to stay on track. Hopefully by this time our contact will begin to ease off and you will be starting to live your new and improved life independently - if not, that is okay, and we have options available to stay working together longer or to focus on specifics required.",
