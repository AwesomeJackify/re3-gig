          Invest in yourself by understanding who you are and how you move. Take
          accountability and stay open-minded. Be teachable, not a know-it-all.
          Reach out for help, recognising that investing in you means seeking
          guidance. Learn when to push yourself and when you might be falling
          into a victim mindset. Share your problems to lighten the load. Avoid
          self-deception and make a genuine commitment to personal growth.

        <p class="font-light text-2xl">
          I grew up in street gangs, committing crimes, addicted to drugs and
          alcohol, with no set routine every dayâ€”just on autopilot and seeing no
          potential in myself. <br /><br />
          This led to ongoing excuses and living in a victim state. <br /><br />
          I fell in love with boxing, but quickly noticed it was my life and mindset
          outside of the gym that were hindering my growth and potential. <br
          /><br />
          I had some honest conversations with myself and with others I looked up
          to. I did all the hard work myself, gathering tools like meditation, breathwork,
          affirmations, and diving headfirst into discipline. <br /><br />
          I completely changed my life, pursued boxing to the fullest, winning some
          of the most prestigious tournaments in NZ. <br /><br />
          I took my role as a father and husband more seriously, provided a legitimate
          income, and I'm now entering my second year completely sober.
